Sassy Ink
=========

A quick and dirty attempt to make a Sass version of [Ink](http://zurb.com/ink). 

Only container width, number of columns, and gutter width are variable. There is much left to be done.

I tried to follow [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)'s structure and keep the generated CSS as close to the original as possible. Compare the Saas generated `ink.css` with the original, `ink-original.css`. Differences include:

* white space
* significant digits (8.333333% vs 8.33333%)
* rounding (16.666666% vs 16.66667%)
* Sass conversion of six-digit hexadecimal colors to color names (#FFFFFF vs white)
